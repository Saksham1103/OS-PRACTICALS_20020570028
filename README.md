      <h1>P1) Implentation of Round robin algorithm sheduling with quanta 3</h1>
      <p1>Practical 1) contains the code for Round robin scheduling algorithm with quanta 3.... while the Practical 2 contains the code to demonstrate fork for parent and child process.... The Round robin scheduling algorithm is one of the algorithm employed by process and network scheduler in computing. In the code we have computed average time and turn around time. We have initialized the time quanta as 3 and have given the arrival time and burst time values in the driver code along with the quanta initialized as 3 and when we run the code then it will has given an average time of 11 and average turn around time of 18.3333.</p1>
      <h2>P2) Demonstration of fork for child parent process</h2>
      <p2>Practical 2) contains the code for demonstrating fork where parent and child run same codes and parent process should be executed first. In Operating System, the fork() system call is used by a process to create another process.
The process that used the fork() system call is the parent process and process consequently created is known as the child process. It has given output as Parent Process.</p2>
